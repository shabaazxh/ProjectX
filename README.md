## Vulkan Renderer
A simple Vulkan renderer with Forward and Deferred shading.
Deferred is the default and most developed. Use Key 9,0 to switch between Forward and Deferred.

## Rendering features: 
* Physically Based Rendering (GGX)
* SSR
* Bloom (Gaussian Blur)

## Debug visuals (Requirs enabling Forward renderer)
* Mip-map visual
* Partial Derivative visual 
* Linear depth
* Mesh density

## TODO:
* SSAO (wip) : Currently an incomplete HBAO implementation 
* Bloom (Next Generation Post Processing in Call of Duty)
